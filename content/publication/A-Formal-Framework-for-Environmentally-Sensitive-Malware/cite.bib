abstract="Theoretical investigations of obfuscation have been built around a model of a single Turing machine which interacts with a user. A drawback of this model is that it cannot account for the most common approach to obfuscation used by malware: the observer effect. The observer effect describes the situation in which the act of observing something changes it. Malware implements the observer effect by detecting and acting on changes in its environment caused by user observation. Malware that leverages the observer effect is considered to be environmentally sensitive.",
