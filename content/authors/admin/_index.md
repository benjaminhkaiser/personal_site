I'm a 3rd-year PhD candidate in Computer Science at Princeton University advised by [Jonathan Mayer](https://www.jonathanmayer.org) in the [Center for Information Technology Policy.](https://citp.princeton.edu/)

My background is in security and privacy, and my current work is on measuring and responding to online disinformation.

I love to teach and mentor. Iâ€™ve taught computing and security basics to students of all ages through [CodeCreative,](https://www.codecreative-ll.org/) [LLCipher,](https://www.ll.mit.edu/outreach/llcipher) [RPISEC,](https://rpis.ec/) and [Princeton INTERFACE,](https://interface-pton.github.io/interface/) among other groups. At Princeton, I TA'd [COS 448](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spring20/cos448/) and [COS 217](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spring20/cos448/).

In my spare time, I like to read science fiction, play tennis, and make craft cocktails.
